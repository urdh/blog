    <p>The <abbr>URL</abbr> you visited doesn't point to anything! There may be several reasons for this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>A broken link got you here</h5>
            <p>In that case, you should let the author of the previous page know that the link is broken, so they can fix it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>The <abbr>URL</abbr> is mis-typed somehow</h5>
            <p>You could either re-type the <abbr>URL</abbr>, or proceed to <a href="{{ site.github.repository_url }}" data-proofer-ignore>the GitHub repository of this blog</a> and search for the page you're looking for.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>What you were looking for never existed</h5>
            <p>If that's the case, I'm afraid I can't help you.</p>
    </ul>
    <p>Whatever got you here, the best way to proceed is probably to visit <a href="{{ site.github.repository_url }}" data-proofer-ignore>the blog archives</a>, or to read one of the posts in the footer below.</p>
